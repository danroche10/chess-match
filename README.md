# Chess game

As an avid chess fan, I wanted to build a python program that enabled a game of chess to be played with all the rules in place.

I found a pygame tutorial for a game of checkers which enabled me to get the initial idea up and running. From there I used my programming knowledge and logical reasoning to build the game up from just pawns to all pieces. Finally, I addressed all of the edge cases (castling, checkmate, pawn promotion), refactored and made the code more readable.

## Usage

### How to run program:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
